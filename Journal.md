### Session 11-30 1:00-4:00

This session lasted about 3 hours of me deciding which type of website I want to create whether that was a multi-page website or a scroll down website and since I had already done something to a multi-page I thought to try out a single long page. In this website I currently have set up the basic parts of the webite which is the outline and what will be on it in general I have been using websites as reference but not their code, however I have been using hw4 when I get stuck because it is similar to what I want my website to look like.

### Session 11-30 4:00-9:00

The outline is done and its very bland I used hw#4 as a reference and to help get a more professional look for the texts but there is still no color, design, or information on screen. However now the navbar I would say is done, and I decided on a color scheme for the website which will be like 5 colors all earthy colors.

After the navbar is finished I changed some of the setting from the ones used in hw#4 to better fit with what I am making and to fit a personal website. Also in this time period I made the "intro" page which is the first page that is seen with a selfie and some generated latin text to make it make look the part till I fill in all the correct info. I also finished previous work section and added filler text and a layout of the button that will download my resume.

### Session 12-1 12:00-4:00

So far I have made some css changes from the code I am using as a reference to better fit with my idea of a professional website. I finished the button that download my offical resume, I did this downloading my resume as a pdf and making it a hyper link to that pdf, but it still needs more testing.

I added projects to the project section, adding pictures of the projects and the name of the projects and for now it has filler text till I fill in the information later. The two projects I added also have to do with html so I have a picture for both and need to set up the git for one of the projects because it was in a gitlab and I will put into a github. The only changes to the css was making the button look better and match the website, along with adding sections for the text in my project to be left leaning or right leaning. Also in Css was I edited the images and how big they were, also how rounded the corners are.
