### Session 11-30 1 pm

This session lasted about 3 hours of me deciding which type of website I want to create
whether that was a multi-page website or a scroll down website and since I had already done
something to a multi-page I thought to try out a single long page. In this website I currently
have set up the basic parts of the webite which is the outline and what will be on it in general
I have been using websites as reference but not their code, however I have been using hw4 when I
get stuck because it is similar to what I want my website to look like.
