### Session 11-30 1-2

This session lasted about 3 hours of me deciding which type of website I want to create whether that was a multi-page website or a scroll down website and since I had already done something to a multi-page I thought to try out a single long page. In this website I currently have set up the basic parts of the webite which is the outline and what will be on it in general I have been using websites as reference but not their code, however I have been using hw4 when I get stuck because it is similar to what I want my website to look like.

### Session 11-30 2:30-9

The outline is done and its very bland I used hw#4 as a reference and to help get a more professional look for the texts but there is still no color, design, or information on screen. However now the navbar I would say is done, and I decided on a color scheme for the website which will be like 5 colors all earthy colors.

After the navbar is finished I changed some of the setting from the ones used in hw#4 to better fit with what I am making and to fit a personal website. Also in this time period I made the "intro" page which is the first page that is seen with a selfie and some generated latin text to make it make look the part till I fill in all the correct info.
