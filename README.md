# ErickFranco Readme and references

You could go to the link in the journal that have the deployment link, however if you want to run a local version first I would git clone
these files onto your local machine, and make sure you are using the finals from that local git clone, next open the files in vscode, than go to the extensions in vscode and download "Live Server", with the files open from your local folder and not in a virtual workshop of sorts, click to the html file and be viewing it, than on the bottom of the screen click on the live server button, and if done correctly the button will be there and open the webpage in your default or recent browser.

In this website I just looked up what the ES6+ coding standard was I don't think I changed much in the code but just in case I did use code or concepts in the js file they came from here or from the hw3 java script.

I actually really liked that I stumbled on this, for hovers it slows down the hover transition by some milliseconds I found it when looking up css changes that might spice up the many hovers that I have maining it just adds a delay from my understanding.

I used the css_font page when looking up the different fonts for my footer as the footer looked really bad saying, "Made by Erick Franco" at the bottom so I found that I could do cursive than I centered it and add some css style being padding and a background which for my eyes ties the bottom really well together.

I just used some of the labeling from here to better add accessibility like aria-labledby which I dont think we used in class it just addes a little accessibility to sections with mulitiple paragraph sections/

This file was a big help for my website especially figuring out the best css setting for certain images and sections, the strucuture is vaguely similar, however I made changes as I went through so the differences could be noted, and of course all the content is different, but the setting for some of the sections was referenced from this hw. Although not directly from this hw I used the navbar from hw1 I belive and spruced it up with the settings from hw4. Lastly the form was also inspired from hw1 or hw2 and added css setting to match the them that I was going for. Although I did use the websites strucuture to help me design mine I changed quite a lot because of the subject and the design flaws and accessibilty flaws that were in this website, but overall it was a big help when I was stuck and or I wanted to make something but just couldn't figure out the settings in css.

How Aria labels are to be used and not overused as it might hurt the listener rather than help them, I think I still might be overdoing it but I followed the responders advice on how much aria to use.

And lastly for the javescript I used the notes from the week we learned java script I dont know if I should link it or not because by the end of the week it will go away as the term is ending, but the PSU web dev slides on the week of javascript I used the structure of a function to make my own.
